# Game-Material

This directory serves as a somewhat comprehensive resource hub, providing a variety of materials that can help you in your game development process. The resources are as follows:

- [Game Assets](./Game%20Assets/): This section contains a variety of ways to gather game assets, including images, audio files, scripts, scenes, animations, materials, shaders, and fonts. These assets can be incorporated into your game development projects to enhance the user experience.
- [Event Driven Programming](./Event%20Driven/): This section provides resources on event-driven programming, a programming paradigm that is crucial in creating interactive and responsive games.
- [Git and GitHub](./Git%20and%20GitHub/): This section offers resources to help you understand and use Git and GitHub, essential tools for version control and collaborative development.
- [Multi-file](./Multi-File/): This section provides resources on multi-file programming in C++. It is useful in large-scale project development. (make sure to check our `C Plus One` Magazine :)
- [Libraries](./Libraries/): This section provides a list of libraries that were used in previous semesters for game development. These libraries contain pre-written code that can save time and effort in your game development process, and also you can check out some demo codes. It's always a good idea to see other people's codes :).

Each section contains a `README.md` file that provides further details about the resources.
