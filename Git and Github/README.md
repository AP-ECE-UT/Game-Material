## Introduction

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and its full history are available on every developer's computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is a command-line tool, but there are many GUI tools available that make it easier to use. Some of the most popular ones are GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, and Sourcetree.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone`: Clones a repository into a new directory.
- `git add`: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Records changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Updates remote refs along with associated objects.
- `git pull`: Fetches from and integrates with another repository or a local branch.
- `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
- `git checkout`: Switches branches or restores working tree files.
- `git merge`: Joins two or more development histories together.
- `git status`: Shows the working tree status.
- `git log`: Shows commit logs.
- `git diff`: Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
- `git stash`: Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away.
- `git tag`: Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG.
- `git remote`: Manage set of tracked repositories.
- `git fetch`: Download objects and refs from another repository.
- `git reset`: Reset current HEAD to the specified state.
- `git rebase`: Reapply commits on top of another base tip.

## Github

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. It offers the basic Git repository functionality, plus adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

GitHub is a platform that allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software. It provides a platform for developers to collaborate on and contribute to open-source projects. It also provides a platform for developers to showcase their work and build a portfolio.
